## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
## Last updated 22 December 2007 for Tor 0.2.0.14-alpha.
## (May or may not work for much older or much newer versions of Tor.)
##
## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the "#" symbol.
##
## See the man page, or https://www.torproject.org/tor-manual-dev.html,
## for more options you can use in this file.
##
## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:

## Replace this with "SocksPort 0" if you plan to run Tor only as a
## server, and not make any local application connections yourself.
SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections
SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost
#SocksListenAddress 192.168.0.1:9100 # listen on this IP:port also

## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept
## all (and only) requests from SocksListenAddress.
#SocksPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
#SocksPolicy reject *

## Logs go to stdout at level "notice" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
## you want.
##
## We advise using "notice" in most cases, since anything more verbose
## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
#Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
## Send every possible message to /var/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
## Use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles
#Log notice syslog
## To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug stderr

## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
RunAsDaemon 1

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
#ControlPort 9051

############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###

## Once you have configured a hidden service, you can look at the
## contents of the file ".../hidden_service/hostname" for the address
## to tell people.
##
## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect requests on port x to the
## address y:z.

#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80

#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/other_hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
#HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22

################ This section is just for relays #####################
#
## See https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay for details.

## A unique handle for your server.
#Nickname ididnteditheconfig

## The IP or FQDN for your server. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
#Address noname.example.com

## Define these to limit the bandwidth usage of relayed (server)
## traffic. Your own traffic is still unthrottled.
## Note that RelayBandwidthRate must be at least 20 KB.
#RelayBandwidthRate 100 KBytes  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
#RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KBytes # But allow bursts up to 200KB/s (1600Kbps)

## Contact info to be published in the directory, so we can contact you
## if your server is misconfigured or something else goes wrong.
#ContactInfo Random Person <nobody AT example dot com>
## You might also include your PGP or GPG fingerprint if you have one:
#ContactInfo 1234D/FFFFFFFF Random Person <nobody AT example dot com>

## Required: what port to advertise for Tor connections.
#ORPort 9001
## If you need to listen on a port other than the one advertised
## in ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), uncomment the
## line below too. You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
## yourself to make this work.
#ORListenAddress 0.0.0.0:9090

## Uncomment this to mirror directory information for others. Please do
## if you have enough bandwidth.
#DirPort 9030 # what port to advertise for directory connections
## If you need to listen on a port other than the one advertised
## in DirPort (e.g. to advertise 80 but bind to 9091), uncomment the line
## below too. You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding yourself
## to make this work.
#DirListenAddress 0.0.0.0:9091

## Uncomment this if you run more than one Tor server, and add the
## nickname of each Tor server you control, even if they're on different
## networks. You declare it here so Tor clients can avoid using more than
## one of your servers in a single circuit. See
## http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#MultipleServers
#MyFamily nickname1,nickname2,...

## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
## to last, and the first match wins. If you want to _replace_
## the default exit policy, end this with either a reject *:* or an
## accept *:*. Otherwise, you're _augmenting_ (prepending to) the
## default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default, which is
## available in the man page or at https://www.torproject.org/documentation.html
##
## Look at https://www.torproject.org/faq-abuse.html#TypicalAbuses
## for issues you might encounter if you use the default exit policy.
##
## If certain IPs and ports are blocked externally, e.g. by your firewall,
## you should update your exit policy to reflect this -- otherwise Tor
## users will be told that those destinations are down.
##
#ExitPolicy accept *:6660-6667,reject *:* # allow irc ports but no more
#ExitPolicy accept *:119 # accept nntp as well as default exit policy
#ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed
#
################ This section is just for bridge relays ##############
#
## Bridge relays (or "bridges" ) are Tor relays that aren't listed in the
## main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even if an
## ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they probably
## won't be able to block all the bridges. Unlike running an exit relay,
## running a bridge relay just passes data to and from the Tor network --
## so it shouldn't expose the operator to abuse complaints.

#ORPort 443
#BridgeRelay 1
#RelayBandwidthRate 50KBytes
#ExitPolicy reject *:*
