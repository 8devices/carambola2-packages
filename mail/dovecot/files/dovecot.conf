# explicitly, ie. default_mail_env does nothing unless you have a namespace
# without a location setting. Default namespace is simply done by having a

# the extra CRs wrong and cause problems.
#mail_save_crlf = no

# Use mmap() instead of read() to read mail files. read() seems to be a bit

#  fcntl  : Use this if possible. Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#  lockf  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#

# When mbox changes unexpectedly we have to fully read it to find out what

# fallbacks to re-reading the whole mbox file whenever something in mbox isn't
# how it's expected to be. The only real downside to this setting is that if

  # Password database is used to verify user's password (and nothing more).
  # You can have multiple passdbs and userdbs. This is useful if you want to
  # allow both system users (/etc/passwd) and virtual users to login without
  # duplicating the system users into virtual database.
  #
  # http://wiki.dovecot.org/Authentication
  #

  # Users can be temporarily disabled by adding a passdb with deny=yes.
  # If the user is found from that database, authentication will fail.
  # The deny passdb should always be specified before others, so it gets
  # checked first. Here's an example:
  #passdb passwd-file {
    # File contains a list of usernames, one per line
    #args = /etc/dovecot.deny
    #deny = yes
  #}

  # PAM authentication. Preferred nowadays by most systems.
  # Note that PAM can only be used to verify if user's password is correct,
  # so it can't be used as userdb. If you don't want to use a separate user
  # database (passwd usually), you can use static userdb.
#  passdb pam {
    # [session=yes] [cache_key=<key>] [<service name>]
    #
    # session=yes makes Dovecot open and immediately close PAM session. Some
    # PAM plugins need this to work, such as pam_mkhomedir.
    #
    # cache_key can be used to enable authentication caching for PAM
    # (auth_cache_size also needs to be set). It isn't enabled by default
    # because PAM modules can do all kinds of checks besides checking password,
    # such as checking IP address. Dovecot can't know about these checks
    # without some help. cache_key is simply a list of variables (see
    # /usr/share/doc/dovecot-common/variables.txt) which must match for the 
    # cached data to be used.
    # Here are some examples:
    #   %u - Username must match. Probably sufficient for most uses.
    #   %u%r - Username and remote IP address must match.
    #   %u%s - Username and service (ie. IMAP, POP3) must match.
    # 
    # If service name is "*", it means the authenticating service name
    # is used, eg. pop3 or imap.
    #
    # Some examples:
    #   args = session=yes *
    #   args = cache_key=%u dovecot
    #args = dovecot

# It's possible to export the authentication interface to other programs,
